# Work-with-Splunk

## Day 1 Checked all connection and functionality 
Have to check everything and make some configurations after that going to creat some events on Windows pc to see if everything works fine on Ubuntu and i can read logs. Let's rock

Faced with a couple errors i guess the reason was my antivirus wich was blocked partly connect between two computers.Everything was solved after on my windows pc through the powershall i made a folder and txt document in spluk directory through this file o power shall command i can send different events on my host ubuntu VM. Sent 1 event first after 10 and 100 with different marks Error, Info etc.

Also created a txt file with all commands that i need to check and maintain Windows and Ubuntu when i start working with splunk.

## Day 2  Splunk Home Lab - Event Monitoring & Alerts
Was testing around 4 hours how everything works

## 1️ Machine Connectivity
- Connected multiple machines in a closed network.
- Verified that events are sent and received correctly between machines.
- Ensured proper data flow to Splunk indexes for monitoring.

---

## 2️ Log Generation & Analysis
- Generated 3,000–4,000 simulated log events with levels INFO, WARN, ERROR.
- Logs uploaded to Splunk and each event verified.
- Extracted important fields using rex.

## 3 Created alerts and learned how to save cvs files
