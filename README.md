# Work-with-Splunk

## Day 1 - Checked all connections and functionality 
Have to check everything and make some configurations after that going to creat some events on Windows pc to see if everything works fine on Ubuntu and i can read logs. Let's rock

Faced with a couple errors i guess the reason was my antivirus wich was blocked partly connection between two computers.Everything was solved after on my windows pc through the powershall i made a folder and txt document in spluk directory through this file o power shall command i can send different events on my host ubuntu VM. Sent 1 event first after 10 and 100 with different marks Error, Info, Warn.

Also created a txt file with all commands that i need to check and maintain Windows and Ubuntu when i start working with splunk.

## Day 3 - Splunk Installation Failure on Windows

I thought that everything works fine but when i started practice on sending events the splunk connection got broken and events stop coming on me host pc. So i decided to take anothere pc and install everything on more time but on clean windows 10.

Goal: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows and connect it to my Splunk Enterprise instance.
Result: ‚ùå Unsuccessful ‚Äî encountered repeated MSI installer errors and permission issues.

Steps Taken
 1. Downloaded the official Splunk Universal Forwarder .msi from Splunk‚Äôs website.
 2. Tried to install normally ‚Üí No ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù button available.
 3. Attempted installation via Command Prompt and PowerShell with:

‚Üí Result: ‚ÄúNo se puede abrir este paquete de instalaci√≥n‚Ä¶‚Äù error.

 4. Verified the MSI file was not corrupted.
 5. Checked permissions ‚Äî account had administrator rights.
 6. Tried extracting MSI to TEMP and running from there ‚Üí same error.
 7. Attempted to enable logging and check Windows Installer service ‚Äî error 2203 and 1402, Rollback\Scripts key missing.
 8. Even on a brand new Windows PC the same MSI error appeared.
 9. Disabled antivirus and firewalls ‚Äî still failed.
 10. After 8+ hours of troubleshooting (MSI repair, permissions, logs) ‚Üí no progress.

Errors Encountered
 ‚Ä¢ Windows Installer Error 2203 & 1402 (permissions & missing registry keys).
 ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNo se puede abrir este paquete de instalaci√≥n‚Ä¶‚Äù despite valid MSI.
 ‚Ä¢ No Rollback\Scripts registry keys present.
 ‚Ä¢ Installation fails before any UI appears.

Resolution

üí° Switched to Linux. Installed Splunk Forwarder on Ubuntu in minutes using .tgz, configured forwarding to Splunk Enterprise, and started generating and analyzing events successfully.

Lessons Learned
 ‚Ä¢ Windows MSI installers can fail even on fresh systems, and debugging is often time-consuming.
 ‚Ä¢ Linux installation is much more transparent (untar + run commands).
 ‚Ä¢ Always have a backup platform (Ubuntu) to continue practicing if one system blocks progress.
 ‚Ä¢ Network and permissions issues are easier to debug on Linux with standard tools (tar, ss, nc, ping, etc.).

## Day 4 - Practice fully on Ubuntu

Today I set up my home lab but based on Linux to practice log ingestion, forwarding, and alerting in a fully offline environment. The lab consisted of:
 ‚Ä¢ Host machine: Ubuntu 24.04 VM running Splunk Enterprise
 ‚Ä¢ Secondary machine: Physical Ubuntu PC acting as a Splunk Universal Forwarder also 24.04

Key Steps Completed

 1. Clean Setup & Installation
 ‚Ä¢ Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on Ubuntu2.
 ‚Ä¢ Configured forwarding to the host Splunk Enterprise instance.
 ‚Ä¢ Verified service status and active forwarders with splunk list forward-server.
 2. Log Ingestion Practice
 ‚Ä¢ Created custom log file /var/log/custom_test.log with multiple event types (INFO, WARN, ERROR) using bash loops.
 ‚Ä¢ Configured inputs.conf to monitor the custom log file and assigned index=main and sourcetype=custom_test.
 ‚Ä¢ Confirmed logs appeared in Splunk Web using searches like:

3. Forwarding & Connectivity Tests
 ‚Ä¢ Verified network connectivity between Ubuntu2 (forwarder) and host VM via ping and nc -vz <host_ip> 9997.
 ‚Ä¢ Observed forwarded events arriving correctly in the host Splunk instance.
 4. Alerts & Testing
 ‚Ä¢ Practiced creating alerts on custom log events (INFO/WARN/ERROR).
 
 5. Lessons Learned
 ‚Ä¢ Linux permissions are crucial; most errors were caused by incorrect ownership or missing directories.
 ‚Ä¢ Forwarder configuration and network setup must match IPs and open ports.
 ‚Ä¢ Offline labs are fully functional for ingesting, searching, and alerting without needing internet.

## Day 5 - SSH,events, more practice

During today‚Äôs session, I continued practicing with Splunk by setting up a functional lab environment using my physical Ubuntu machine as the forwarder and my Ubuntu VM (hosted on Windows) as the Splunk indexer. I verified network connectivity, configured ports and firewalls, and ensured proper forwarding between the two systems.

I generated different types of custom log events (INFO, WARN, and ERROR) and sent them to Splunk for indexing. After confirming their ingestion, I set up alerts based on specific event types to simulate security monitoring scenarios. Additionally, I began working with Dashboards, creating visual representations of the data to improve analysis capabilities.

I also explored sending SSH connection logs, alerting on connection errors, and visualizing this data in real time. This helped reinforce essential SOC skills like log collection, event classification, alerting, and visualization ‚Äî all crucial for incident detection and response workflows.

## Day 7 - Splunk Log Monitoring & SOC Lab

Today I focused on building a hands-on log monitoring workflow using Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Forwarder. The main tasks completed were:
 1. Environment Setup: Verified connectivity between Ubuntu VMs, ensuring the forwarder sends logs to Splunk Enterprise successfully.
 2. Log Generation & Testing: Created synthetic logs including INFO, WARN, ERROR, and SSH failed login events. After starting the log generator, events were received in real time by Splunk.
 3. Live Event Dashboard: Built a SOC-style dashboard displaying event counts by type, top SSH attacker IPs, and recent events, with color-coded severity for easy visualization.
 4. Alerts Configuration: Set up real-time alerts for SSH failures, ERRORs, and WARNs, enabling immediate notification of anomalies.

Key Learnings:
 
‚Ä¢ Handling unmatched events (NULL) and labeling them for better visualization.

‚Ä¢ Creating real-time dashboards and alerts to simulate SOC monitoring.

‚Ä¢ Practical experience with log generation, ingestion, and visualization in a controlled lab environment.

## Day 8 - Splunk Lab: Real-Time Log Monitoring, Field Extraction, Dashboards & Alerts

Environment Setup
 
 ‚Ä¢ Host PC: Ubuntu with Splunk Enterprise
 
 ‚Ä¢ VM / Remote PC: Ubuntu with Splunk Universal Forwarder
 
 ‚Ä¢ Verified SSH connectivity between host and forwarder.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Splunk Forwarder installed and configured to send logs to Splunk Enterprise.

‚∏ª

Log Preparation

 ‚Ä¢ Created a custom log file: /var/log/custom_test.log
 
 ‚Ä¢ Generated different log types:
 
 ‚Ä¢ INFO ‚Üí normal events (e.g., User logged in, Page served)
 
 ‚Ä¢ WARN ‚Üí warnings (e.g., Slow DB query, High memory usage)
 
 ‚Ä¢ ERROR ‚Üí errors (e.g., Permission denied, Service crashed)
 
 ‚Ä¢ Simulated failed SSH login attempts with dynamic usernames, IPs, and ports.

 ‚Ä¢ Confirmed logs were ingested in real-time by Splunk after enabling the log generator.

‚∏ª

Field Extraction

 ‚Ä¢ Used Field Extractor (rex) to extract:
 
 ‚Ä¢ username
 
 ‚Ä¢ src_ip
 
 ‚Ä¢ port
 
 ‚Ä¢ Verified fields appeared correctly in search results and in dashboard panels.
 
 ‚Ä¢ This allowed aggregation, visualization, and alerting.

‚∏ª

Dashboard Creation
 
 ‚Ä¢ Created a new dashboard combining all extracted fields.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Panels included:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Top attacking IP addresses
 
 ‚Ä¢ Top targeted usernames
 
 ‚Ä¢ Recent failed login events
 
 ‚Ä¢ Set dashboard to refresh every 1 minute for real-time monitoring.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Tested PDF export functionality to practice report sharing.

‚∏ª

Alerts
 
 ‚Ä¢ Created alerts for suspicious IPs based on thresholds (e.g., multiple failed logins).
 
 ‚Ä¢ Alerts were linked to extracted fields (src_ip) and could trigger notifications.

‚∏ª

Observations
 
 ‚Ä¢ Real-time logs worked as expected üëç
 
 ‚Ä¢ NULL values appeared in some columns ‚Äî caused by failed SSH login events, normal in this lab setup
 
 ‚Ä¢ Geolocation columns (Country/City) were empty because IPs were private lab addresses ‚Äî expected behavior in a home lab
 
 ‚Ä¢ Dashboard visualization allowed quick identification of suspicious activity across multiple fields

## Day 9 ‚Äì Home Lab expanded
Date: 2025-10-16

Summary:
Today I expanded my home lab by integrating my new server (PC3) with the existing environment. The goal was to practice multi-device log forwarding, SSH management, and real-time monitoring in Splunk.

## Work Completed:

## 1. Hardware Integration:
 ‚Ä¢ Added PC3 (i5 4th Gen) to the lab.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Installed 2√ó1TB HDDs in PC3.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Connected PC3, PC2, and the host laptop to the new TL-SG105E switch.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Configured switch with basic settings:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Access to web interface.

 ‚Ä¢ Default QoS and VLAN settings for lab network.
 
## 2. Operating System & Network:

 ‚Ä¢ Installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 on PC3.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Configured static IP for PC3: 192.168.1.10/24 via netplan.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (router)
 
 ‚Ä¢ DNS: 192.168.1.1

 ‚Ä¢ Connected host laptop via WiFi, PC2 via Ethernet.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Ensured PC3 is reachable via SSH from PC2.

 ‚Ä¢ Note: If the router is turned off or devices reconnect, dynamically assigned IPs (DHCP) may change unless static IPs are set on all machines or reserved in the router.
 
## 3. Splunk Forwarder Setup:

 ‚Ä¢ Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on PC3.

 ‚Ä¢ Configured forwarder to send logs to the Splunk host (host laptop).
 
 ‚Ä¢ Verified connectivity and forwarding using nc and splunk list forward-server.
 
## 4. Testing & Monitoring:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Confirmed active forwarders on the Splunk host.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Tested sending logs from PC3 through SSH-managed terminals.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Verified that the host receives logs correctly.

## Challenges:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Initial confusion with IP addressing and Splunk session login.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Minor troubleshooting required for firewall and forwarder configuration.

## Key Takeaways:

 ‚Ä¢ Multi-device lab setup allows practicing realistic SOC workflows.

 ‚Ä¢ SSH access to servers enables headless management.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Splunk forwarders can be configured on multiple machines, sending logs to a central host for monitoring.

 ‚Ä¢ Static IPs are important for consistency in lab environments to prevent connection issues.

## Next Steps:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Practice sending custom logs from PC3 and verifying them in Splunk.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Automate log generation and forwarding for real-time dashboard updates.

 ‚Ä¢ Continue expanding lab with more scenarios and alerts.

## Day 10 ‚Äì Home Lab Practice (Splunk + Server Management)

## What I did today:

 1. Server Management via SSH

 ‚Ä¢ Managed PC3 (server) from PC2 using SSH.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Opened two terminals simultaneously:

 ‚Ä¢ One for monitoring logs.

 ‚Ä¢ One for server management and configuration.

 ‚Ä¢ This setup made managing the server more convenient without needing to use the host laptop directly.

 ## 2. Log Forwarding & Monitoring
 
 ‚Ä¢ Confirmed that PC2 and PC3 are sending logs to the Host Laptop (running Splunk Enterprise).

 ‚Ä¢ Tested sending custom logs from PC3 using:

echo "Hello Splunk! $(date)" | sudo tee -a /tmp/test_splunk.log

‚Ä¢ Verified logs appear in real-time on Splunk.

 ## 3. Live Log Generator
 
 ‚Ä¢ Started automatic log generation on PC2 and PC3 (server) to simulate real-time events.

 ‚Ä¢ Observed logs from both PCs flowing into Splunk dashboards.

 ## 4. Switch Configuration

 ‚Ä¢ Renamed the switch to a friendly name.

 ‚Ä¢ Verified port mapping:
 
 ‚Ä¢ Port 1 ‚Üí Router

 ‚Ä¢ Port 2 ‚Üí PC2
 
 ‚Ä¢ Port 3 ‚Üí PC3 (Server)

 ‚Ä¢ Port 4 ‚Üí Host Laptop

## Notes & Insights:
 ‚Ä¢ Host Laptop is mainly receiving logs; PC2 acts as the control terminal for server management.
 ‚Ä¢ Multiple SSH sessions make it easy to monitor and manage the server at the same time.
 ‚Ä¢ Lab environment is now fully functional with 3 computers + switch + router, ready for further practice and log experimentation.
