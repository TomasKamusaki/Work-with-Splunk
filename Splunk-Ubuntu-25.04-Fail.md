# Splunk-Ubuntu-25.04-Fail
📘 This lab is for educational and ethical testing only, performed on my own isolated network
Splunk Installation (Windows & Ubuntu)

My first days in cybersecurity

Spent arount 15 hours of 2 days on Splunk 25-26 of September 2025. Day befor spent 6-7 hours but got the same result with Wazuh 24 of September 2025

Was using my home lab: 2 computers wich had closed local network without internet + one more laptop with internet conection to be able to send something on usb and after share + old router 

During this project, I explored installing and configuring Splunk Universal Forwarder for the first time as part of my introduction to cybersecurity and Linux/Windows systems. I used ChatGPT as a technical assistant to guide me through commands, troubleshooting, and configuration steps.


## What I Attempted:
 
 • Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows, configuring TCP forwarding to a remote Splunk indexer.

 • Tried multiple installation methods, including PowerShell commands and MSI execution with administrative privileges.
 
 • Configured forwarders to monitor Windows event logs and forward data to a Splunk indexer.
 
 • Attempted installation on Ubuntu 25.04 to explore Linux deployment.

 • Worked with two computers (host and target) connected in a closed network via another router without Internet access.

## Results – Successes:
 
 
 • Successfully installed and configured Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows.
 
 • Verified network connections and data forwarding through TCP logs.
 
 • Learned to read Splunk log files, monitor ingestion, and troubleshoot warnings.
 
 • Documented the process with screenshots for future reference.

## Challenges / Blockers:

 • Ubuntu 25.04 version was unsupported, causing installation errors and repository issues.
 • MSI installation on Windows initially failed due to command and privilege issues, which required repeated troubleshooting.

## Skills Developed:

 • Troubleshooting complex installations in Windows and Linux environments.
 • Learning cybersecurity monitoring tools in a real-world environment.
 • Persistence, documentation, and problem-solving using AI-assisted guidance.

## Outcome:
 
 • Gained practical experience with Splunk on Windows and Ubuntu.
 • Built a personal learning portfolio with screenshots, logs, and step-by-step documentation.
 • Improved understanding of network forwarding, monitoring, and Splunk configuration.


On Ubuntu 24.04 works good. Spent just 2 hours to connect everething.
Finally going to sleep.
